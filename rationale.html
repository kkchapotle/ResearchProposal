  <h1>Rationale</h1>
  
  <p>How can we educate health care providers to feel confident in diagnosing and supporting these women? What kind of protocol can we develop to allow for direct referral partnerships with perinatal mental health specialists and programs? How can we provide information to all women and families that enter a health care facility on PMADs that include signs and symptoms to address with their provider? How can we destigmatize PMADs in Oregon? If we are able to educate all health care providers, women, and families in Oregon effectively about PMADs, then we can strengthen the diagnosis and de-stigmatization of them.</p>
