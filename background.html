     <h1>Background</h1>
    <p>Perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMAD)- occurring during pregnancy and after- include depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and postpartum psychosis. The consequences of PMADs being untreated can result in poor birth outcomes, family stress, impaired maternal/infant attachment; long-term health, emotional, and developmental problems in children; and in rare cases suicide and infanticide. In Oregon, we have effective screening and treatment available, yet at least half of cases are never diagnosed. Part of the reason for this is the overall stigma surrounding mental illness, espeically maternal mental illness, because of how women are concerned with feeling like, and being seen by others as a “bad mom” leading to missed diagnosis. Health care providers also lack the education to feel comfortable to diagnosis, assess, and refer patients with PMADs. With an efficient diagnosis, PMADs can be prevented and treated leading to better overall well-being for moms and their children.</p>
