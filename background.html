  <p>A clinical trial was conducted at two obstetrics and gynecology (ob-gyn) clinics at the University of Washington in Seattle, WA to determine whether “a collaborative care depression intervention” would be beneficial in diagnosing and treating depression in women while being seen by an ob-gyn. Data was collected from the clinical notes of each woman’s first and follow-up appointments to determine the frequency and factors associated with depression diagnosis. 
The only option for many women, espeically low-income and minority, to be diagnosed and treated for depression is by their ob-gyn, making it a desirable setting for collaborative care. Results found were that unless women were being seen specifically for depression and asked directly about their symptoms, they were unlikely to be diagnosed for depression. One claim by the authors for this, is that “no guidelines recommend screening for depression in obstetrics and gynecology settings, excluding perinatal period.” 
While this study aims to inform of the benefits of collaborative care, the authors recognize the many limitations of it. The trial conducted only at campus clinics, the clinician’s knowledge of the trial during it, and all patients included were prescreened and diagnosed with depression, as a result they were not able to compare screening for depression of those without depression.</p>

    <p>The consequences of PMADs being untreated can result in poor birth outcomes, family stress, impaired maternal/infant attachment; long-term health, emotional, and developmental problems in children; and in rare cases suicide and infanticide. In Oregon, we have effective screening and treatment available, yet at least half of cases are never diagnosed.</p>
