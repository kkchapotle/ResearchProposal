            <p>I want to study why pregnant and postpartum women in Oregon with perinatal mood and anxiety disorders are being under or missed diagnosed while receiving care at health care facilities in Oregon.<br> The reason for this is due to my personal experience with maternal mental illness-not being diagnosed and non-treatment of it-that I believe in the importance and value of providing the treatment and support needed for women with mental illness.</p>
